      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="text-1">
        While still early in my web development and design career, I am keenly focused on delivering superior results. I have spent the past year developing my
        online, web based business known as flyfishfinder.com. This has not only stretched me in web design, but all aspects of building and running an e-commerce
        business from the ground up. I strictly focus on WordPress as my Content Management System of choice. I am expanding into the freelance sector and am eager
        to offer my best services on your next project!

        <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
        <p>Responsive web design is of great importance in the world today. More people use phones than ever before. What works on computers doesn't perfectly translate
          to mobile devices. Keying in on the most important design factors on each screen, those things that get your customers to convert is what I focus on.</p>

        <h3>Customization</h3>
        <p>Each client has unique needs. Being able to listen and understand the vision a person has for their project is half the battle. I focus on high quality, affordable priced site builds.
          I am partial to several cleanly coded themes, where I strip them down and start my designs from scratch. I will keep you appraised of progress all along the way so that we can
      make corrections at checkpoints rather than at the end.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I am fluent in current HTML5 and CSS3 programming, and can utilize some Java Script to further build out functionality on your site. Often with WordPress, the themes I use are cleanly coded so this keeps programming to a minimum, and ultimately saves you money.</p>
